# discord-portal-bot
A (somewhat idiosyncratic) Discord bot for creating "portals" between channels to redirect conversations.

Features:
- Can be addressed by name (Lua)
- To create a portal between channels, ask it to redirect followed by the channel tag. (e.g. "Lua, redirect #general"; "Lua redirect this convo to #memes please"
- Some other fun stuff also. If you just say her name, she says hi; if you ask her to kill she will oblige; if you call her a good girl she will be tsundere about it
